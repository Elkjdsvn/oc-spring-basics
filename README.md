# Spring Framework Basics Learning Repository

This repository contains projects and code samples as I learned the fundamentals of the Spring Framework through a Spring Boot course on OpenClassrooms.

**Purpose:**

This repository was created to explore and understand the core concepts of the Spring Framework, a leading framework for building enterprise Java applications.  
It focuses on foundational aspects like Dependency Injection/Inversion of Control, and Spring Boot.
Throughout the course, I created an API to handle an Employee database with the Model/Service/Controller/Repository-layered architecture.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

* **Spring Framework Core:**
    * **Dependency Injection (DI):**  Demonstrates understanding and implementation of DI using annotations.
    * **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container:**  Usage of the Spring IoC container to manage application components (Beans).
    * **Bean Configuration:**  Configuration of Spring Beans using annotations.
    * **Application Context:**  Working with the Spring Application Context to manage beans and application lifecycle.
* **Spring Boot:**
    * **Spring Boot Starters:**  Usage of Spring Boot Starters to simplify project setup and dependency management through Spring Initializr.
    * **Auto-configuration:**  Understanding and leveraging Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities.
    * **Embedded Server (Tomcat):**  Demonstrates running a Spring Boot application with an embedded server.
* **Spring Data:**
  * **Basics:** Use of Spring Data to connect to an in-memory H2 Database through the CrudRepository interface exposed by the framework.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Java JDK 21**
* **Spring Boot 3.4.3**
* **Maven**
* **Visual Studio Code**

**Later improvements:**
* **Capabilities:** Adding more data tables and data handlers to the API to represent more accurately the Human Resources service of a company as this was the original guidance from Openclassrooms' course.
* **Docker:** Creation of a Dockerfile to allow rebuilding and running the API locally.
* **Deployment:** Finding a way and a platform for the project to be deployed.
